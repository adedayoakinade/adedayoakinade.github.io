  abstract = {Respectful human-robot interaction is informed by local cul
ture. This article describes an on-going project to equip Pepper humanoid
 social robots with the ability to interact verbally and non-verbally with
 people in Rwanda and South Africa in a culturally sensitive manner. We
 describe an exercise to acquire Rwandan cultural knowledge by means of
 an online survey, targetting spatial, verbal, and non-verbal communica
tion. Each type of knowledge in the survey is structured using a cultural
 knowledge ontology. We describe the development of a complete system
 architecture which uses this cultural knowledge to interact with people,
 illustrating the approach with one specific example in which a Pepper
 robot gives visitors a short tour of a robotics laboratory. The system
 is implemented in the Robot Operating System (ROS) by developing
 a package of ROS nodes that provide functionality for overt attention
 (based on detection & localization of sounds, people, and faces), speech
 understanding and production, animate behavior, deictic, iconic, and
 symbolic gesture, and navigation. The robot mission is coordinated by
 a ROS behavior controller node that interprets the use case scenario
 specified by a behavior tree.}

  abstract = {Advances in social robotics have led to increased interest in designing robots that can communicate effectively with humans through non-verbal gestures. One approach to enhancing the naturalness and expressiveness of robot gestures is to incorporate biological motion, which mimics the velocity and acceleration profiles observed in human gestures. This paper examines the use of biological motion for gestural communication by humanoid social robots, focusing on the impact of biological motion on the perceived warmth and effectiveness of robot gestures in fostering engagement while interacting with these robots. The exercise involved implementing the minimum jerk model of biological motion on a Pepper humanoid social robot and conducting user studies to evaluate the impact of biological motion on human-robot interaction. The results show that incorporating biological motion cues can significantly increase the perceived warmth of robot gestures and improve the overall effectiveness of gestural communication, resulting in more natural and engaging human-robot interaction}

  abstract = {This work developed a cost-effective framework for agriculturists to regularly monitor their crops against intruding rodents and other security concerns using modern drone technology through configuration and deployment of an autonomous UAV which also functions as a remotely piloted vehicle. This was done by configuring a quadcopter capable of causing a disturbance when a rodent is observed through an inbuilt alarm system whose sound is amplified to be loud enough to cause the animals to leave the farm area. A framework for real-time image and live video transmission from the farm to a designated remote base station was developed. This was achieved through programming codes that configured the drone to operate an intelligent alarm and object tracking systems which enables a live feed from the UAV using Arduino IDE and Mission Planner for autonomous flight control. The requisite algorithms were developed using the framework of tracking, learning and detection (TLD) in the OpenCV software. The drone movement is equally controlled remotely over a Wi-Fi network using an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module for redirection and controlling of the drone movement to monitor specific locations.}

  abstract = "Machines have become an essential part of day-to-day human activities; their volume and frequency of usage have rapidly increased in every sector. These machines, especially the computer system, are well known for their speed, accuracy, repeatability, and use to execute tasks that can be harmful to humans. However, these machines lack intelligence, as they do not possess the ability to think like humans. The quest for producing machines with thinking capabilities led to artificial intelligence; thus, many efforts were channeled towards developing devices that can communicate with their surroundings, making a logical decision on what has been perceived, and then provide the proper solution to the problem. To achieve this feat, machine learning is utilized by subjecting the system to a series of training using algorithms and data mining techniques, which is similar to how humans learn from infancy till adulthood and then execute tasks based on knowledge and the experiences they have gathered growing up. While these technologies opened a creative horizon for technological development, there is a current demand for intelligent user interfaces with high usability that can sustain the mode of interaction depending on users, tasks assigned, and the environment. This chapter attempts to present an overview of how data mining can be incorporated with machine learning to produce a machine with artificial intelligence and how both can improve the intelligent user interface."

      abstract = { With a projected increase in world population to about 2.3 billion by the
                          year 2050 and the corresponding challenges this increase would have on the
                          provision of healthcare for the populace, there arises a need for a drastic
                          improvement in the current state of the healthcare industry in order to
                          overcome the challenges. A shift from the usual reactive approach to
                          healthcare, in which health conditions would have deteriorated before
                          treatment begins, to a more proactive methodology, which focuses on early
                          diagnosis, identification and prevention of health conditions and wellness
                          management is needed. This can be achieved by making health condition
                          monitoring and well-being management a huge priority. Thus, considerations
                          must be given to Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, as they can impact
                          positively in designing, building and maintaining intelligent,
                          interconnected and individually tailored healthcare services and products.
                          With the aid of IoT technologies, individual physical conditions can be
                          monitored continuously and remotely and actions are taken as necessary.
                          Also, a proper record can be kept for individual health conditions and their
                          progress levels monitored, thus, enabling healthcare providers to better
                          evaluate and detect early symptoms of health problems. Although with the
                          adoption of the IoT in healthcare, a lot of benefits are obtainable, there
                          are still some concerns, including security, standards, scalability and
                          privacy. These concerns seem to overwhelm the seemingly broad opportunities
                          available in IoT and must be tackled to facilitate the application of IoT.
                          This chapter aims to open up the techniques and advantages of IoT in
                          personalized healthcare. It also opens up the challenges and possible
                          solutions that can be adopted in tracking and monitoring health status. }

  abstract={Fire incidents are disasters that can potentially lead to the loss of life and property. It can also leads to a temporal or permanent 
disability on the affected victim. The primary duty of fire fighters is to handle fire incidents, which often exposed them to high risks 
when carrying out the task of extinguishing fire, especially in hazardous area. This study presents the development of a fire 
extinguishing robot with SMS alert feature that can raise an alarm to notify occupants of the building, send an alert SMS message to 
a registered phone number, and also proceed to extinguish the fire unmanned. It is designed to be compact in size in order to ease 
movement into narrow spaces. The robot is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to avoid collision with any obstacle and objects in 
the surrounding, while the flame sensor alongside a smoke sensor, were used to detect the fire. This developed autonomous system 
demonstrates capabilities of identifying fire locations automatically and extinguishes the fire using the stored mixture in the 
container placed on it. }

  abstract={Road travelling is among the simplest modes of transportation. Accidents are frequently the consequence of a human error on the road, and they can occasionally be brought on by alcohol intake which alters the victim's way of thinking. Law enforcement agencies have made significant efforts to lower the risk of drunk driving, but none have been able to significantly diminish it. Due to this, the proposed system was developed to lessen the likelihood of accidents on our roads being brought on by intoxicated drivers. The device can prevent a drunk driver from operating the vehicle and, in the event of an accident, send a message to a pre-programmed number informing it of the location of the vehicle. The entire software is built around a microcontroller, an alcohol sensor, and a vibration sensor. The sensor is used to set an alcohol threshold at which an alarm will buzz, and when the set threshold is exceeded, the flow of fuel to the engine will cease, thereby bringing the car to a halt. In case of an auto crash, the microcontroller would receive input from the attached vibration sensor, and send the location of the vehicle to a pre-registered phone number on the subscriber identification module (SIM) of the project. This project is a prototype of what is proposed in a vehicle where the DC motor serves as the fuel pump.}
