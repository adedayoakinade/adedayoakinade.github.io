# Course description
This hands-on course provides a basic understanding of embedded systems development (embedded processor architectures, programming, and design); models of computation for embedded systems; modeling, specification, synthesis, and verification; hardware/software implementation; performance analysis and optimization; and project design methodologies and associated tools.

# Learning objectives
Students will learn about different chips such as PIC and Arduino. Assembly, C programming and Arduino programming will be studied, and some industrial applications will be realized. Students can expect to learn how to program with the embedded architecture that is ubiquitous in smartphones, portable gaming devices, robots, etc. Through a series of laboratory exercises with state-of-the-art embedded microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators, students will acquire skills in the design and implementation of core embedded systems.

# Outcomes
After completing this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the principles of micro-computers and embedded programming

- Understand hardware and software for embedded microcontrollers

- Understand the interaction of key devices (buses, memory architectures, memory management, device drivers)

- Use simulating tools for designing and developing embedded systems

- Plan installation and maintenance of embedded systems

- Prepare reports and technical reviews for embedded software development reviews

- Carry on independent investigation on embedded systems of their failure

- Demonstrate problem-solving using embedded programs
