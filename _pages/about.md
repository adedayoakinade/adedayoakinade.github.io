Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a Research Associate in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University Africa, with a research focus on Human Robot Interaction and Soft Robotics, 
<!-- zI am passionate about developing robots which can interact with humans in a culturally-competent manner. -->

I holds a Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Mechattronics Engineering from Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria and a Master of Science - Advanced Studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. 
<!-- [Optional: Add a sentence about awards, fellowships, or notable achievements.] -->

Outside of research, I am an avid video gamer, and enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and human life.
